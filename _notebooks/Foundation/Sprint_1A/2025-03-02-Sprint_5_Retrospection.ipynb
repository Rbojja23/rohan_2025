    "| **Sprint 5 Retrospection**            | 5          | 4.5        | My five main things, planning, frontend creation, api creation, crud implementation, and deployment assitant admin roles, were all throughly explained throughout the blog, and supported with images and screenshots of work proof. I beleive this deserves a 4.5 because of the implemntations of the API showing iteration from the very first couple of times they were integrated, from just onto the forntned, into a seperate file in the abckend, to being inputted into model files to create a database. |\n",
    "| **Full Stack Project Demo**     | 2          | 1.75        | The demo covered all of the required CPT requirments, and showed a functioning CRUD output and input, fetch request to the outsourced API, and unique output of all the listed flights, that eases the user. However, the reason this doesnt earn anymore than a 1.75, is because of its simplicity, not only with the user. It could be improved in terms of complexity with who edits what entry, and although it is mainly meant to be a public feature (e.g. to display delay times), it may be beneficial to add admin roles, when I recently though that wasnt neccesary.|\n",
    "| **Project Feature Blog** | 1          | 0.9        | The blog, along with CPT/FRQ lanugage, and while sourcing the Big Ideas, clearly explains the proccess of how to do Full sTakc implementation, testing with postman, backend database inquires, and other methods that college baord requires us to know. I made the blog throughough with adding visuals and screenshots to show proof of concept and functionality. |\n",
    "| **MCQ Review & N@TM**                         | 1          | 0.9        | Although my perofrmance on the MCQ was slightly above par for myself, I would still like to improve in the areas we've discussed. I still gave a 0.9 due to the thorough review of the MC, where everys ingle incorrect quesiton was restated and reasoned throguh. For the N@TM, I also went ot three differnt booths and took notes, interacting with the hosts, and showing proof of visiting. I also analyzed our results from our interviewers and people who stopped by, where we scored higher than an average rating, showing the attrativness of the features. |\n",
    "| **Contributions to Team**              | 1          | 0.9       | Not only as being an Assistant Deployment Admin, but I also feel I was always consistent with presentations. Wether it be with reviews with Mr. Mortneson, or also helped our scrum amster take head of the Kanabn board, I have since been an integral part of the organization of the team. Likewise, I have created the majority of the Figma, which was key to cohesive UI designing. I created records of the deplyoment blog with file reords, important DNS information, and updated it with steps throughout the proccess. |\n",
    "| **Overall Score**                           | 10         | **8.95**    | For next steps, when working on this feature in the future, I would like to implement more unqiue CRUd features, such as a calender, etc. I would also like to apply my knowledge ot intenrships, as I am also doing currently with molecular dynamics and python. I would also like to carry forward by deployment skills by attempting to deploy a website creation of my own in the future, which could be beneficial to my own learning, while also putting my skills to use to show future interviewers and even friends. |\n"
