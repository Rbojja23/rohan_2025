    "- By veiwing others CRUD functionality and how it was implemented, it taught me thatit doesnt have to be a simple feature such as editing a rating, but rather, implemented in a calender format or other unique method.\n",
    "- the UI doesnt have to be completely straightforward, but implementing game like features, or something to pull in the user, could be beneficial to the overall program value.\n",
    "- A cohesive theme throughout the features is greatly important to the website itself, so the user is able to track each feature for the enccesary information, and connect between them.\n",

It uses proper funcitonality with unqiue features, sucha s a calender, where CRUD operations can remove, add, or edit events. One improvment I would give them would be on their presentation, as it was not well rehearsed and did not cover all the features as well as it could have been. Hwoever, what I enjoyed the most was the UI design, as it seemed unqiue and it stood out in the crowd.\n",

The funcitonality of thsi website was spot on, with teh game aspect showing an impressive understanding of the javascript on frontend design. However, one improvment is making the UI of the testing part better, as it could really tie in the whole project.\n",
