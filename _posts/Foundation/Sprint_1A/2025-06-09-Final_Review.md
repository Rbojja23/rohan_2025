# Project PYRE

### Main Component and Role in the Application

The core feature I developed was the **revamped Statistics Page**, a dual-module system combining historical wildfire data and real-time weather analytics. These components work together to offer users a clear understanding of **why, where, and how fires are occurring**, along with current situational awareness.

#### Wildfire Statistics API

This module scrapes and parses official government datasets to display:

- **Human-caused fire incidents**
- **Total acreage burned**
- Year-over-year comparisons and trend visualizations

This empowers users to analyze **human impact on wildfires**, helping drive both awareness and potential policy actions.

#### Weather Situational Report

Integrated with the **OpenWeather API**, this tool provides:

- **Current weather conditions** by location
- **Fire-prone indicators** like wind speed, humidity, and temperature
- **location-aware dashboard** to assess fire risk in real time

This component ensures users can quickly access **localized risk assessments** to guide decisions and stay safe.

### Unique Qualities

- **Dual-source data integration**: Combines official wildfire data with live weather feeds to create a **multi-dimensional understanding of fire risk**.
- **User-centric dashboard**: Prioritizes clarity and usability with clean data visuals and instant access to key stats.
- **Focus on human accountability**: Highlights **human-driven wildfire causes**, emphasizing the social responsibility aspect of fire prevention.
- **Real-time situational reporting**: Provides up-to-date environmental data to help users make **informed safety decisions** on the spot.

### Unique Traits I Brought to the Project

- **Efficiency**: I streamlined data retrieval and parsing processes to reduce API latency and improve load times, ensuring **fast, responsive user experiences**.
- **Problem-Solving**: When facing API formatting inconsistencies and missing data fields, I implemented **robust error handling and fallback logic** to keep the dashboard reliable under any condition.
- **Technical Agility**: I integrated multiple APIs (government and weather) with **minimal redundancy** using clean, modular code structures for easy debugging and scaling.



# Homework Success

Homework success in this course extended far beyond simply completing assignments—it was about extracting deeper understanding and applying that knowledge in meaningful ways. I treated each homework as both a practice opportunity and a teaching moment.

---

### Beyond the Homework

What made this experience truly valuable was the **quality of the lessons attached to the assignments**. These lessons weren't just average walkthroughs—they were **clearly taught above the standard**, covering not only core concepts but also edge cases, real-world applications, and strategic thinking. There were **four standout lessons** that I repeatedly returned to during review sessions.

As I worked through each assignment, I focused on understanding the *why* behind each concept. This helped me solidify my grasp on the material far better than rote memorization would have.

---

### Learning Through Teaching

One of the most impactful parts of the experience was **teaching the material to others**. I often found myself explaining problems and walkthroughs to peers, which made me realize how much deeper my own understanding became. As the saying goes, *“If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.”* Teaching forced me to think critically and anticipate where confusion could arise—this greatly helped me when I faced similar problems on the **AP Exam**.

### Structured Review and Growth

In addition to completing homework, I followed a **consistent review routine** that involved:

- Going back through lessons after each assignment
- Reworking missed questions with fresh strategies
- Revisiting top lessons before the AP Exam

This structured approach, combining **reviewing homework** and **revisiting high-yield lessons**, allowed me to develop a strong mental map of the material and ultimately **perform confidently on the AP Exam**.

### Summary of Impact

- **Homework served as an active learning tool**, not just a task
- **Teaching reinforced my learning** and helped me internalize complex topics
- **Structured review strategies** helped me perform well on the AP Exam
- Developed **discipline and metacognition** by analyzing what I didn’t know, and seeking clarity
