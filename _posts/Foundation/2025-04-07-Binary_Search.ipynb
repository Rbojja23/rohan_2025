    "\n",
    "### **1. Three Aspects of the Digital Divide**  \n",
    "The digital divide consists of three main factors: device access, internet connectivity, and digital skills. Students without personal computers or tablets struggle to engage in online learning, especially in low-income households. Poor internet access, particularly in rural areas, limits students‚Äô ability to use online resources like virtual classrooms. Additionally, a lack of digital literacy makes it harder for students to complete assignments that require internet-based research or technical skills.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Digital Divide in Urban vs. Rural Areas**  \n",
    "Urban and rural communities face different digital divide challenges. In cities, the main issue is affordability, as low-income families may not be able to pay for internet or devices despite having the infrastructure available. Rural areas, however, often lack broadband access, making remote learning difficult. Solutions include subsidized internet programs for urban families and government investment in expanding broadband in rural areas.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. The Impact of COVID-19 on the Digital Divide**  \n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic exposed and worsened digital inequities. Many students lacked the technology or reliable internet needed for remote learning, leading to academic setbacks. The closure of libraries and community centers also cut off access to free internet, leaving disadvantaged students without alternatives. Additionally, some teachers were unprepared for online instruction, making learning even more difficult for students with less tech-savvy educators."

    "## Sudan\n",
    "\n",
    "Sudan's main digital divide lies in digital litereacy and internet speeds, which were caused by poltical instability. The implications that can occur as a result of this divide is lack of integration with the world economy, as technology is now vital to communicating with other economical powerhouses. Without this simple literacy, it becomes nearly impossible to interact with foreign investors.\n",

    "- Average Itnenet Speed: 15.4 Mbps\n",
    "- Digital Literacy: 26%\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: One solution is creating community technology centers, sparsely, but impactfully. With classes on digital literacy taught by educated voulenteers, the digital literacy rate can increase from 26% to a hopeful 50% in due time. This communtiy center can also increase internet penetration from 31% to at least above 45%, as   access to the internet can be avialable at these centers. Finnaly, implementing center hotpsots, with portability, can increase internet speeds allowing for more efficent communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Saudi Arabia\n",
    "\n",
    "Saudi Arabia is already tehcnoligiccly advanced, with its internet penetration at 98%, very close to fulyl being accesible. However, its average intenet speed is lacking, in comparsion to being such a devleoped country. Therefore, the main digital divide is the Internet speed gap, which can cause implications, such as lack of efficent communication. Furthermore, this can cause misinofmration spread with misunderstandings, decrease in effeicncy of the goverment procceses, and even simple public communciation.\n",

    "- Average Itnenet Speed: 109.2 Mbps\n",
    "- Digital Literacy: 72%\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: One solution is increased government funding in public center mobile hotposts, or increased bandwiths. By increased the amount of cell service towers, and wifi availabel in these city centers, the average internet speeds can increase. To do this, legislation can be passed with overall approval from the government, to order new communicty centers to be implemented, which will incoprorate tehcnology to increase wifi speeds. Wifi router companies cna also be invested in, the contribute to this problem."
